- [ ] Implement Roe-type solver and characteristic reconstruction
- [ ] Increase to 2D

## Development Log

### Jun. 6, 2022
- create equation of state classes.
- define stiffened gas eos.
- define eos as a member for simulation definition.
- adapt the solver, accordingly.
- first time to log the development.


### Jun. 19, 2022
- reformat the userspecification, ease the loop for equations
